One of the main challenges I faced was how to work with things that implemented the AsyncRead and AsyncWrite traits. So, here are some ways to 'upgrade' them into Futures, Sinks and Streams to gain access to the various combinators provided by them.</p> <p class=date><span class=date-inner>2018-11-25</span></p><li><h2><a href=https://jsdw.me/posts/neural-nets/>Neural Networks: An Introduction</a></h2> <p>An introduction to feed-forward neural networks with learning via back propagation.</p> <p class=date><span class=date-inner>2018-01-19</span></p><li><h2><a href=https://jsdw.me/posts/haskell-language-extensions/>Haskell: Some Awesome Language Extensions Explained</a></h2> <p>A guide covering some of the more awesome/useful/interesting looking Haskell language extensions that I've come across so far, with plenty of examples.</p> <p class=date><span class=date-inner>2015-08-22</span></p><li><h2><a href=https://jsdw.me/posts/haskell-cont-monad/>Haskell: A Look at the Continuation Monad</a></h2> <p>Some notes I developed on the continuation monad in Haskell as a result of exploring how they work and how to use them, complete with plenty of examples along the way.</p> <p class=date><span class=date-inner>2015-06-07</span></p><li><h2><a href=https://jsdw.me/posts/haskell-parsec-basics/>An introduction to parsing text in Haskell with Parsec</a></h2> <p>Parsec makes parsing text very easy in Haskell.
