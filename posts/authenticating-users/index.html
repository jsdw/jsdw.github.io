Here are some things that are worth considering.<h1 id=use-https>Use HTTPS</h1><p>However you choose to authenticate users, use HTTPS. If you do not, somebody can sit between a user and your application and see the password that they enter being sent across plain text, or (if you avoid doing it yourself) see the access code handed to your app. If they do this, they have the chance to masquerade as that user or worse.<p>HTTPS encrypts communication between the user's browser and your application, making this impossible. Somebody snooping on the network traffic can see which IP addresses your browser is communicating with, but they can't see the actual URL or data being transferred back and forth.<h1 id=can-you-avoid-doing-it-yourself>Can you avoid doing it yourself?</h1><p>Github, Google, Facebook and various other services allow users to authenticate with <em>them</em> instead. <strong>OAuth</strong> is a common protocol for doing authorisation (and authentication as a by-product), and a common OAuth flow works like so:<ol><li>A user who wants to log in is redirected to the authentication service.<li>The user logs in with them instead, and they are then redirected back to your app with an <em>access code</em>.<li>Your app then talks directly to the service, exchanging that access code with an <em>access token</em>.</ol><p>Now, your app can use the access token to obtain some unique ID for the user, and associate state (for example, a shopping cart) with that ID. It doesn't ever have to store passwords, handle password resets, or handle registering users. A bunch of these services also offer multi-factor auth, so your users can benefit from this extra security with no extra effort on your side.<p>One downside is that users have to register with one of the services you use instead (the upside is that they probably already have done so).<p>Something to be aware of is that you still have to treat the access token you obtain securely, and you still have to think about <em>sessions</em> (see below).<h1 id=don-t-store-passwords>Don't store passwords</h1><p>If you want or need to implement your own authentication system, don't store passwords in your database. Hash passwords using a <em>cryptographic hash function</em> designed for this purpose, such as <code>bcrypt</code>. This converts a password into a fixed-length random-looking sequence of bytes. You can then store that instead. Things to consider when hashing passwords:<ul><li>Cryptographic hash functions are one-way, so a hacker cannot convert the bytes back into a password. They <em>can</em> however try hashing lots and lots of passwords until they find one that hashes to the <em>same</em> string of bytes. This means that the hash function should be <strong>slow</strong>, so that it takes a substantial amount of time to do so. <code>bcrypt</code> is deliberately slow for this reason.<li>You can configure how slow hash functions like <code>bcrypt</code> are; this is the <em>cost factor</em>. The lower it is, the quicker somebody can brute force a hash to work out what password was used to create it. Pick a speed that is fast enough for your needs but no faster.<li>Hackers can build up a map from hash to password for common hash functions like <code>md5</code>. To defeat this, always <em>salt</em> your passwords. A salt is some random bytes, ideally generated using a <em>Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator</em> (CSPRNG). Append these bytes to the password before hashing it, and also store those bytes in your database next to this hashed password. Now, we can append the same salt to password attempts before hashing them to compare with the original.<li>Use a <em>different</em> salt for every password you hash. This means that even if multiple users use the same password to log in to your app, they will all look completely different when hashed.<li>Instead of manually working with salts, just use <code>bcrypt</code>, which does it all for you automatically. <code>bcrypt</code> generates a salt and appends it to the output hash so that it can compare new password attempts against the hashed one.<li>It might be worth adding a <em>pepper</em> to passwords as well. To do this, store some random string of bytes outside of your database, and encrypt each hashed password with it. If a hacker compromises your database, the encrypted passwords will be utterly useless if they do not also find the pepper so that they can decrypt them.</ul><p>This boils down to just using <code>bcrypt</code> or something similar with a decent cost factor, and possibly encrypting passwords with a pepper for that extra layer of security.<h1 id=don-t-have-an-unhelpful-password-policy>Don't have an unhelpful password policy</h1><p>Longer passwords are normally better, so don't arbitrarily limit your user to having a really short password.<p>There are technical limits to password size, but there shouldn't be anything wrong with a password that is a couple of hundred characters in length.<p><a href=https://www.troyhunt.com/passwords-evolved-authentication-guidance-for-the-modern-era/>This Page</a> covers a bunch of useful bits in this area and is well worth a read.<h1 id=sessions-and-jwts>Sessions and JWTs</h1><p>Browsers do not maintain any sort of persistent connection with your application. Once a user has logged in, their browser will need to let your app know who they are each time it communicates with it.<p>This is what <em>sessions</em> are for. The basic approach is this:<ol><li>When a user logs in, your application generates a random session ID (ideally using a CSPRNG), and stores it in a database alongside the ID of the user that's just logged in.<li>Your application then sends this session ID back to the user's browser (normally in the form of a <em>Set-Cookie</em> header).<li>Each time the user's browser communicates with your app, it sends this session ID to it (this happens automatically if it was set as a Cookie). The application can then look it up and find the corresponding user ID.</ol><p>Session IDs should be random and sufficiently long; somebody should not be able to work out what any other session IDs are from the one that they have. If they manage to do this, they can pretend to be somebody else.<p>As an alternative to generating a random ID, you might decide to create a <em>JSON Web Token</em> (JWT) instead. This is a token constructed in a standard format that can contain arbitrary data, and can be <em>signed</em> and optionally <em>encrypted</em>. If the signature is valid, it guarantees that the JWT has not been modified, and was created by your app. If it's encrypted, the browser can't view the content of the JWT.<p>An advantage of JWTs is that they if they contain enough information, your application can avoid a database lookup, since it can verify and trust the contents of the token. This can help when building distributed and stateless apps. A disadvantage is that, since the token is trusted without any need for database checks and so on, you cannot <em>untrust</em> them. A valid token will continue to be valid until it expires. Some notes about JWTs:<ul><li>JWTs define <em>how</em> they are signed in their header. Make sure that you expect them to be signed in a certain way, and don't allow tokens that have not been signed in this way (an unsigned token is perfectly valid, but no longer has any guarantees about who made it).<li>JWTs are <strong>not</strong> encrypted by default, so while they look opaque because they are base64 encoded, users can read the contents of them.<li>If you hand the JWT to a browser, make sure it doesn't live for too long. If it gets stolen, the malicious user will have free reign until it expires. One way to limit the chance of it getting stolen in the browser is to place it in an HTTP-only cookie, so that JavaScript can't read it.<li>If you do urgently need to invalidate tokens, and you control enough of the infrastructure, you can change the public/private key pair that was used to sign them, so that existing tokens will no longer have a valid signature. However, the public key has probably been cached anywhere that validates the token, and so you'd need to be able to clear those, too.</ul><p>For simple apps, I think it's easier to generate and use your own session IDs. The database hit is often acceptable, they can be revoked if needed by simply deleting the session from the database, and they are pretty simple to understand and therefore do right. You may have a good use case for JWTs though.<h1 id=protecting-users>Protecting users</h1><p>Now that you have users, it's important to protect them while they are using your application.<h2 id=cross-site-request-forgery>Cross Site Request Forgery</h2><p>One type of attack worth mentioning here is a Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Here, an attacker convinces some user of your application to visit a malicious site. This malicious site can try to load images or contain links that make arbitrary <code>GET</code> requests to your application. It can also contain forms that can be sent via <code>POST</code> or <code>GET</code> to your application. By interacting with or simply visiting such a site, a user might end up making requests to your application.<p>This is especially dangerous if the user is currently logged in to your application, as the requests made could lead to actions being carried out on their behalf. This is because cookies are (by default) sent along with any request made to your site; this includes the session ID cookie that would tell your application what user is making the requests.<p>Some different things that you can do to protect yourself include:<ul><li>Ensuring that any <code>GET</code> request does not alter any state on behalf of the user. With this in place, only submitting forms from malicious sites can be dangerous (since they can target routes that require <code>POST</code>).<li>Associating a users session with a token—often a randomly generated string—which cannot be discovered by an attacker due to Same Origin restrictions. This token can be returned in the page HTML or headers when it's served, or made available as a Cookie. When a request is made to the server, this token is expected to be sent along with it. Since the hacker doesn't know what the token is, they can't send a valid request.<li>Setting the <code>SameSite</code> attribute on cookies containing sensitive information (like the session ID). This attribute prevents cookies from being sent if the originator of the request is a different domain. Thus, the malicious site owned by the attacker would be able to make requests to your application, but cookies protected by this attribute would not be sent along with them. Your application would see these requests as being unauthenticated, as they have no session ID attached. This only protects users with <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=same-site-cookie-attribute">modern browsers</a>.<li>Don't send the session ID as a Cookie. If the session ID is not set as a cookie, it is not automatically sent with every request, and so requests from a malicious site would all appear to be unauthenticated. Instead, you'd have to use JavaScript to attach a session ID to requests as needed. This does mean that if an attacker gains control of the JavaScript that runs, they can discover the session ID.</ul><p>In general, it's well worth reading <a href=https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md>this OWASP cheat-sheet</a>, which goes into a lot more detail on how to prevent CSRF attacks.<h2 id=cross-site-scripting>Cross Site Scripting</h2><p>A Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attack is when an attacker manages to inject malicious code into your site that is then executed when a user visits it. Any site that takes user input in some form and reflects that in the output without proper sanitisation is vulnerable, because that input might contain malicious code that is then run when other users view it.<p>If an attacker gains control over JavaScript that runs on your page, they can do all sorts of malicious things, such as logging key presses as a user logs in to steal their credentials. You must ensure that your site is safe from this class of attacks, especially if you handle and work with user data. One of the benefits of using an external authentication service is that your site can avoid handling such data at all, limiting exposure if you do fall foul of an XSS attack.<p>Have a read through <a href=https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md>this OWASP cheat-sheet</a>, which explains XSS attacks in much more detail, and walks through some rules that you can apply in order to avoid them.<h1 id=summary>Summary</h1><p>To briefly summarise the above again in a way that should cover simple authentication setups:<ul><li>Always use HTTPS.<li>Use <code>bcrypt</code> or similar to hash passwords, and consider adding a pepper as well for good measure.<li>Allow long passwords.<li>Use long, randomly generated session IDs to keep track of logged in users. Consider JWTs if you have a need for them.<li>Use HTTP only cookies to avoid those session IDs from being stolen by malicious JavaScript.<li>Be careful to understand and prevent CSRF attacks, which would allow an attacker to perform actions within your application on behalf of the logged in user.<li>Ensure that your site is not susceptible to XSS attacks, which are particularly dangerous if you handle sensitive user data like login credentials.</ul><p>Following these points should help you reduce the risk of hackers being able to impersonate your users, and minimise the fallout if what you have stored gets into the wrong hands.<p>We should never assume that our application is un-hackable, but by thinking about security at each stage we can strive to reduce the damage done in the event that a security flaw is found and exploited.</div></div></section><footer></footer></div><script src=https://jsdw.me/page.js></script>
