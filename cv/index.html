A bit of a language geek, with experience ranging from JavaScript and TypeScript to Go, Rust, Python, Haskell and Elm. My primary focus is building Web Applications in JavaScript/TypeScript using frameworks such as React, but I enjoy working across the stack, having built web services in Go, Rust, Haskell and Node.JS, deployed services using Docker, Kubernetes, Helm and Terraform, and worked with databases such as MongoDB, PostgreSQL and MySQL. Good UX and API design is important to me, as is robustness, simplicity and maintainability.</summary><div class=sections><section class=professional><h1 class=section-title>Professional</h1><project-section> <header><h1>Senior Frontend Engineer, <project-location>Secondmind</project-location></h1><date-stamp>January 2019 – Present</date-stamp></header> <p>As one of two frontend focused engineers at Secondmind, my primary role is to develop web applications and prototypes for our product offering, as well as internal tooling.
